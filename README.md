#HackRPI2023

Hi! Our names are Felipe, Sofia, Brina, and David. Our project is a machine learning model that predicts who would and would not seek help in colleged aged students.

In this model, we take in a CSV file of students at the college level, the data is categorized into an ID, to prevent any data from the same student, Gender, their Major, GPA, Class Status, Marital Status, 
wether or not they have depression, wether or not they have anxiety, wether or not they have panic attacks, and if they've seeked treatment previously. 

The purpose of this is to take into account daily life factors and try and predict what people to target and reach out more to for not seeking help, and hopefully prevent any harm. 
All life is precious and most people do not reach out for help so we hope this project could help make a difference.
