#HackRPI2023

Hi! Our names are Felipe, Sofia, Brina, and David. Our project is a machine learning model that predicts who would and would not seek help in college-aged students.

In this model, we take in a CSV file of students at the college level, the data is categorized into an ID, to prevent any data from the same student, gender, major, GPA, class status, marital status, whether or not they have depression, whether or not they have anxiety, whether or not they have panic attacks, and if they've sought treatment previously. 

The purpose of this is to take into account daily life factors and try and predict what people to target and reach out more to for not seeking help, and hopefully prevent any harm. 

All life is precious and most people do not reach out for help, so we hope this project could help make a difference.
